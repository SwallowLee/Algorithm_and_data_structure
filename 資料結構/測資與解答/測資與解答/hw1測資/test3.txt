ABSTRACT Sequential pattern mining finds the frequent subsequences or patterns 
from the given sequences. TPrefixSpan algorithm finds the relevant frequent patterns 
from the given sequential patterns formed using interval based events. In our 
proposed work, we add multiple constraints like item, length and aggregate to
the interval based TPrefixSpan algorithm. By adding these constraints the efficiency 
and effectiveness of the algorithm improves. The proposed constraint based 
algorithm CTPrefixSpan has been applied to synthetic medical dataset. The algorithm 
can be applied for stock market analysis, DNA sequences analysis etc.
KEYWORDS Sequential patterns, temporal patterns, Constraints, Interval based 
events. 1. INTRODUCTION Data mining is useful in various domains such as market 
analysis, decision support, fraud detection, business management and so on. 
Sequential pattern mining is an approach to extract information from input 
sequences [1]. Various methods have been proposed for mining temporal
patterns in sequence databases such as mining repetitive patterns, trends and 
sequential patterns. Sequential Pattern Mining is a popular technique which consists 
of finding subsequences appearing frequently in a set of sequence. However, 
knowing that a sequence appear frequently is not sufficient for making predictions. 
Sequential pattern mining approaches are classified as Apriori [2] or generate and 
test approach, pattern growth or divide-and-conquer approach. The Apriori and 
AprioriAll algorithms are based on apriori property and use the generate join
procedure to form the candidate sequence. It identifies frequent item set in the 
database and extends it to a larger item set as those item set appears sufficiently in 
the database. Some of the widely used apriori based algorithms are GSP [3], SPADE 
[4] and SPAM [5]. Pattern growth algorithms allow the frequent item set discovery 
without candidate item set generation. They first build the data structure called 
FP-tree. Frequent Pattern tree consists of nodes corresponding to items and counters. 
This tree reads only one transaction at a time and maps it to a path. Then it extracts 
the frequent item set directly from the FP-tree. Some of the widely used pattern 
growth Algorithms are PrefixSpan [6] and FreeSpan [7] . A projection based
pattern-growth method is used in PrefixSpan (Prefix-projected Sequential pattern 
mining) algorithm for mining sequential patterns. Its major idea is that, instead of 
projecting sequence databases by considering all the possible occurrences of 
frequent sub sequences, the projection is done on frequent prefix which results in 
higher efficiency of the algorithm in terms of processing time. The TPrefixSpan [8] 
algorithm is developed to mine the temporal patterns from interval- based events. 
Interval-based events are defined as the pair of time values associated with each
event. Temporal pattern mining includes various tasks like temporal pattern analysis 
and comparison, temporal classification, temporal association rules, temporal 
clustering and temporal prediction [9]. TPrefixSpan algorithm deals with mining 
frequent temporal patterns from interval based events in a given sequence database. 
This paper discusses about adding multiple constraints with TPrefixSpan algorithm 
which increases the performance of TPrefixSpan algorithm and reduce the 
computational time. Constraints based PrefixSpan algorithm discovers sequential
patterns which are frequent and also satisfy aggregate, length, and item constraints. 
In this work, Constraint based algorithm CTPrefixSpan is proposed to discover 
frequent temporal patterns considering item, length and aggregate constraints.
2. Literature survey In [4] R.Srikant and R.Agarwal proposed an algorithm called ¡§GSP¡¨ 
(Generalized Sequential Pattern) algorithm which is an apriori based approach for 
mining frequent patterns. SPAM: SPAM (Sequential Pattern Mining) [5] uses a vertical 
bitmap data structure representation of database which is similar to the given id-list 
of SPADE. It integrates the concept of GSP [4], SPADE [6] and FREESPAN [7] 
algorithms. FreeSpan [7] is the frequent pattern projected sequential pattern mining 
algorithm which mines frequent sequences, finds the frequent patterns
and uses the projected database to find the growth of subsequent fragments. Pie et 
al. [6] proposed a projection based sequential pattern mining algorithm called 
PrefixSpan algorithm (Prefix-projected Sequential Pattern mining), which mines the 
frequent patterns from a given data sequence. In [8] Wu-Chen proposed a 
non-ambiguous temporal pattern for interval-based events. TPrefixSpan algorithm 
was proposed to mine the new kind of temporal pattern from interval based events. 
Irfan Khan [10] included multiple constraints with the existing PrefixSpan algorithm 
to improve the efficiency of PrefixSpan algorithm. Similarly, to improve the efficiency
of TPrefixSpan algorithm constraints are included and CTPrefixSpan algorithm is 
proposed in this work. 3. Existing system Interval-based events are represented by 
two end points. The end point represent the start time and end time of the intervals. 
Projection method for interval-based events is different from that of point-based 
events. This form of representation is used in TPrefixSpan algorithm. TPrefixSpan
algorithm is slower than PrefixSpan algorithm as representing the interval based 
events requires larger space. In TPrefixSpan algorithm, initially the length of the 
sequential pattern is found. Then the set of frequent temporal 1-patterns is found 
from a given sequence database. These steps are repeated until the all frequent 
patterns are found. All frequent patterns from the sequences are generated. In 
TPrefixSpan algorithm ¡§Temporal Prefix¡¨, and ¡§Temporal Postfix¡¨ projected databases 
are to be found and the definitions are given below. The following 2 definitions are 
based on the definitions in [8]. 3.1 Definition: (Temporal prefix) 4. Proposed system 
To improve the efficiency of the existing TPrefixSpan algorithm, we need to add more 
constraints like length, item and aggregate on the output of frequent patterns. 
Multiple constraints based sequential pattern mining extracts the sequential patterns 
which are of user¡¦s interest. By adding multiple constraints in interval based events 
the run time of finding frequent patterns from the given sequences will increases. 
We can use this constraints based algorithm in finding relevant sequences from the 
given medical data set and also to find the particular stock details in finance data set. 
It decreases the patterns from relevant frequent patterns according to the input 
sequences given. For any particular stock it gives the relevant patterns with respect 
to user¡¦s interest. By adding multiple constraints in interval based events the run 
time of finding frequent patterns from the given sequences will increases. We can 
use this constraints based algorithm in finding relevant sequences from the given 
medical data set and also to find the particular stock details in finance data set. It 
decreases the patterns from relevant frequent patterns according to the input 
sequences given. For any particular stock it gives the relevant patterns with respect 
to user¡¦s interest. Let us discuss how to generate patterns from given constraints by 
using our given algorithm. 4.1. Requirements: 4.1.1 To find the length and minimum 
support: From the given sequence database find the length and set minimum 
support initially as 0.5. 4.1.2 Apply TPrefixSpan algorithm: To mine the frequent 
patterns we are applying existing TPrefixSpan algorithm proposed by Wu and Chen 
[8]. TPrefixSpan algorithm is the pattern mining algorithm to find maximum number 
of frequent patterns from interval based events. 4.1.3 Constraints added: After 
applying TPrefixSpan algorithm the multiple constraints like item, length and 
aggregate constraints are added to refine the result according to user¡¦s interest. The 
various constraints added in our paper are explained below: Item Constraints: An 
item constraint is defined as the subset of items that should or should not be present 
in the patterns [10]. For example,when mining sequential patterns over a stock 
market, a user may be interested in the patterns that have details about the day high 
price. The patterns that contain details about the day high are considered as 
interesting patterns. This enhances the effectiveness of the algorithm by providing 
patterns according to user¡¦s interest. Length Constraints: A length constraint specifies 
the requirement on the length of the patterns, where the length can be either the 
number of occurrences of items or the number of transactions [10]. For example, a 
user may want to find longer patterns (i.e., at least 4 prices) in stock analysis. Such a 
requirement can be expressed by a length constraint and thus interesting patterns 
can be identified. Aggregate Constraint: An aggregate constraint is the constraint on 
an aggregate of items in a pattern, where the aggregate function can be sum, 
average, max, min, standard deviation [10]. For example, a user may want to find the 
frequent sequential patterns where the average number of cost related to the prices 
is over 3. By applying TPrefixSpan algorithm the frequent patterns mined are shown 
in Figure 2. After applying Length constraint the resulting frequent patterns are 
shown in Figure 3. Algorithm: CTPrefixSpan () Input: Temporal Sequence Database S. 
Output: Frequent patterns, Interesting patterns satisfying user specified constraints 
Begin Step 1: Identify frequent temporal 1-patterns in S. Considering the frequent 
temporal 1-pattern generated identify the projected database. Step 2: Generate 
frequent patterns with frequent 1-pattern as prefix. Identify the projected database. 
Repeat Step 1 and 2 until all the frequent temporal patterns are mined. Get the 
constraint type from the user. If constraint specified is item constraint then Identify 
the patterns that has the item (event) specified. Else if constraint specified is length 
constraint then Identify the patterns with length= length specified Else if constraint 
specified is aggregate constraint then Identify the patterns that matches the 
aggregate specified End if Generate interesting patterns that satisfy the constraints 
End . Result Analysis Our CTPrefixSpan algorithm improves the efficiency and 
effectiveness than other sequential pattern mining algorithms. The runtime and 
Precision of both TPrefixSpan and CTPrefixSpan can be analysed by using medical or 
finance datasets. Though our algorithm increases the runtime, the precision rate of 
the proposed CTPrefixSpan algorithm is almost equal to 1. 5.1 Performance 
Evaluation To evaluate the performance of our CTPrefixSpan, we implemented the 
TPrefixSpan algorithm for comparison. Both these algorithms were implemented 
in .NET language and tested on an Intel core windows 7 system using Micrososft 
Visual Studio package. The runtime of these two algorithms are compared with 
different length of output patterns. Finally, we calculated the Precision rate of 
TPrefixSpan and CTPrefixSpan algorithms with different data sets. Finally, it was 
found that our algorithm increases the runtime. But the precision rate is always 
nearest to value 1. 5.2 Runtime Comparisons The precision value is calculated by 
using relevant patterns and retrieved patterns with respect to TPrefixSpan and 
CTPrefixSpan algorithms. After calculating the precision it is found that our 
CTPrefixSpan algorithm has a precision rate of 1. Finally it can be concluded that 
after applying constraints with TPrefixSpan the runtime may increase but the 
precision rate of the proposed algorithm is high. 6. CONCLUSIONS TPrefixSpan 
algorithm finds the relevant frequent patterns from the given data sequences 
representing interval-based events. It is the most efficient interval based algorithms 
among the sequential pattern mining algorithms. Adding multiple constraints like 
item and length to the mined patterns increases the scalability, accuracy and hence 
increases the efficiency of the proposed CTPrefixSpan algorithm. Authors M.

Abstract¡XThe mining of closed sequential patterns has attracted researchers for its 
capability of using compact results to preserve the same expressive power as 
conventional mining. However, existing studies only focus on time point-based data. 
Few research efforts have elaborated on discovering closed sequential patterns from 
time interval-based data, where each data persists for a period of time. Mining 
closed time intervalbased patterns, also called closed temporal patterns, is an 
arduous problem since the pairwise relationships between two interval-based events 
are intrinsically complex. In this paper, an efficient algorithm, CEMiner is developed 
to discover closed temporal patterns from interval-based data. Algorithm CEMiner 
employs some optimization techniques to effectively reduce the search space. The 
experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets indicate that CEMiner not 
only significantly outperforms the prior interval-based mining algorithms in terms of 
execution time but also possesses graceful scalability. The experiment conducted on 
real dataset shows the practicability of time interval-based closed pattern mining. 
Keywords- closed temporal pattern; endpoint representation; sequential pattern 
mining; time interval-based data INTRODUCTION Recently, sequential pattern mining 
is an active research topic in data mining for its wide applications such as customer 
analysis, network intrusion detection, discovery of tandem repeats in DNA sequences, 
study of scientific and medical processes, to name a few. Many efficient algorithms [1, 
4, 9, 10, 15, 16, 22] proposed so far have good performance for discovering 
complete-set frequent patterns. But when mining long frequent sequences, or when 
using low support thresholds, the performance of such algorithms usually degrade 
dramatically. For example, assume a database contains only one long sequence 
{(a1)(a2)(a3)¡K (a100)}. If the minimum support is 1, in the complete-set frequent 
pattern mining, there will be (2100 ¡V 1) frequent patterns: {a1:1, a2:1, ¡K, 
(a1)(a2)(a3)¡K(a100):1}. All of them except (a1)(a2)(a3)¡K(a100):1 are redundant, 
since all the other frequent patterns and their supports can be derived from this 
pattern. Undoubtedly, a long sequential pattern usually contains an explosive 
number of subsequences and using low support threshold often bears huge number 
of computations. When a user or an application only needs the longest or more 
expressive sequential pattern, closed pattern mining algorithm may be a better 
alternative. We can avoid exhaustive enumeration of all frequent sequences and thus 
improve the performance. Hence, the mining of closed sequential patterns has 
attracted researchers for its capability of using compact results to preserve the same 
expressive power as complete-set frequent patterns mining. Previous researches of 
closed sequential pattern mining [3, 7, 17, 21, 23] mainly focus on time point-based 
data. There has been no efficient method developed for mining closed sequential 
pattern from time interval-based data. However, in many real world scenarios, some 
events, which intrinsically tend to persist for periods of time instead of instantaneous 
occurrences, cannot be treated as ¡§time points¡¨. In such cases, the data is usually a 
sequence of events with both start and finish times. Examples include library lending, 
stock fluctuations, patient diseases, and meteorology data. Actually, discovering 
closed sequential patterns from time interval-based data can reveal more interesting 
patterns. For example, in the medical field, the simple ordered sequence of events 
such as may be inadequate to express the complex relationships among symptoms. If 
we consider the duration time of events, some relationships can be mined from 
clinical records of patients to study the correlations between the symptoms and the 
diseases, or the influences between the diseases and other diseases. One may find 
that ¡§in the case of myocardial infarction, chest pain usually contains the cardiac 
enzymes increasing.¡¨ Another discovery might be that ¡§in many tuberculosis patients, 
the presence of coughing up blood usually overlaps intermittent fever.¡¨ Existing time 
point-based approaches are hampered by the fact that they can only handle 
instantaneous events efficiently, not event intervals. We can perceive that time 
point-based issue is just a special case of the time interval based issue (where start 
time is identical to finish time), but not vise versa. Mining closed time interval-based 
patterns (also referred to as closed temporal patterns) is more complex and arduous, 
and requires a different approach from mining time point-based data. So far, little 
effort has been paid to the issue of mining closed time interval-based sequential 
patterns. This is partly because of the complicated relationship among event 
intervals. Since the feature of time interval is quite different from time point, the 
pairwise relationships between any two time interval-based 2011 11t events are 
intrinsically complex. This complex relation is really a crucial bottleneck when we 
endeavor to design an efficient and effective algorithm for mining closed temporal 
patterns, since the complex relations may lead to generate larger number of 
candidate sequences and workload for counting the support of a candidate sequence. 
Allen¡¦s 13 temporal logics [2] are comprehensively used to describe the relations 
among intervals, as shown in Fig. 1. Considering the arrangements of the start and 
the finish endpoints, there are 13 temporal relations between any two event 
intervals as: ¡§before,¡¨ ¡§after,¡¨ ¡§overlap,¡¨ ¡§overlapped by,¡¨ ¡§contain,¡¨ ¡§during,¡¨ ¡§start,¡¨ 
¡§started by,¡¨ ¡§finish,¡¨ ¡§finished by,¡¨ ¡§meet,¡¨ ¡§met by,¡¨ and ¡§equal.¡¨ However, all the 
Allen¡¦s logics are binary relation and may suffer several problems when describing 
relationships among more than three event intervals. An appropriate representation 
is very crucial for facing this circumstance. Various representations [5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 
19] have been proposed but most of them have restriction on either ambiguity or 
scalability. The contributions of this paper are as follow: We simplify the processing 
of complex relations among intervals by capturing the global information of all 
endpoints in a sequence. Comparing with the complex relations between intervals, 
the relations among endpoints are simple, i.e., only ¡§before,¡¨ ¡§after¡¨ and ¡§equal.¡¨ 
Various existing representations may lead to different kinds of problem. We develop 
a compact representation, endpoint representation, to express a pattern or sequence 
nonambiguously. Endpoint representation can facilitate the process and improve the 
performance of algorithm. A novel algorithm, CEMiner, which stands for Closed 
Endpoint Temporal Miner, is proposed to discover closed temporal patterns 
efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, CEMiner employs some optimization 
strategies to reduce the search space and avoids nonpromising closure checking and 
database projection. Experimental studies on both synthetic and real datasets 
indicate that proposed strategy and algorithm are both efficient and scalable and 
outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Our experiments also show that the 
proposed approach consumes a much smaller memory space. The remainder of this 
paper is organized as follows. Section 2 and 3 provide the related work and some 
preliminaries, respectively. Section 4 introduces the endpoint representation. Section 
5 describes the CEMiner algorithm. Section 6 gives the experiments and performance 
study, and we conclude in Section 7 2.1 Closed Sequential Pattern Mining CloSpan 
[21] is the first algorithm for mining closed sequential patterns from time point data. 
It generates a set of closed sequence candidates and then do post-pruning to 
discover closed sequential patterns. Although it performs two pruning methods to 
reduce search space, it still consumes much memory to maintain the set of historical 
closed sequence candidates. BIDE [17] is a fast algorithm for mining closed 
sequential patterns. Different from CloSpan, it uses a sequence closure checking 
scheme to avoid the maintenance of closed candidate sequence. The Proposed 
BackScan pruning method can prune the search space more aggressively than the 
methods used in CloSpan. COBRA [7] is a two-phased mining algorithm. It first finds 
all closed frequent itemsets [23], and then extends search space with only these 
frequent closed itemsets. Because COBRA uses both vertical and horizontal database 
formats to reduce the searching time in mining process, the memory usage is a major 
problem. 2.2 Complete-set Temporal Pattern Mining Some recent works have 
investigated the mining of complete-set temporal patterns. Kam et al. [8] designed 
an algorithm that uses the hierarchical representation to discover temporal patterns. 
However, the hierarchical representation is ambiguous and many spurious patterns 
are found. Hoppner [6] defined the supporting level of a pattern as the total time in 
which the pattern can be observed within a sliding window. But the algorithm needs 
to scan the database repeatedly, which would significantly lower its efficiency. H-DFS 
[13] was proposed to discovery frequent arrangements of event intervals. This 
approach transforms an event sequence into a vertical representation using id-lists. 
Hence, H-DFS does not scale well when the temporal pattern length increases. TSKR 
[12] expressed the temporal concepts of coincidence and partial order for interval 
patterns. The pattern represented in this format is easily understandable but may 
reveal the relationship between pairwise event intervals in a pattern ambiguously. 
Based on MEMISP [9], an algorithm ARMADA [18] is proposed to find frequent 
temporal patterns from large database. This approach only needs two database scans 
and does not require candidate generation or database projection. Wu et al. [19] 
devised a nonambiguous expression, temporal representation, and TPrefixSpan 
algorithm to discover frequent temporal patterns. Although this algorithm only need 
two scans of the database, it does not employ any pruning strategy to reduce the 
search space. Patel et al. [14] utilized additional counting information to achieve a 
lossless hierarchical representation, named Augmented Representation, and 
proposed an algorithm, IEMiner. Although IEMiner uses some optimization strategies 
to reduce the search space and remove nonpromising candidate sequences, it still 
has to scan database multiple times. HTPM [20] was developed for mining hybrid 
temporal patterns from event sequences, which contain both point-based and 
interval-based events. A new robust representation, SIPO [11], utilizes the 
boundaries of interval and further considers the noise tolerance to express 
relationships among intervals. The mining algorithm requires discovering both closed 
sequential pattern and closed itemset. Based on a compact representation, 
coincidence representation, CTMiner [5] is an efficient algorithm for mining temporal 
patterns. Algorithm also proposed some pruning strategies to significantly reduce the 
search space. All of these algorithms only focus on mining closed sequential patterns 
from time point-based data or mining temporal patterns from time interval-based 
data. No effort has been put to closed temporal pattern. In this paper, we discuss and 
design an efficient method to discover closed temporal patterns from interval-based 
data. The time interval-based mining problem is much more difficult than time 
point-based mining issue. Since the time period of the two intervals may overlap, the 
relation among event intervals is intrinsically more complicated than that of the 
event points. Allen¡¦s 13 temporal logics [2], in general, are adopted to describe the 
relations among intervals, as shown in Fig. 1. Unfortunately, when describing 
relationships among more than three events, Allen¡¦s temporal logics may suffer 
several problems. A suitable representation is very important for describing a 
temporal pattern. As mentioned above, various representations have been proposed 
but most of them have restriction on either ambiguity or space usage. In this paper, a 
new expression, endpoint representation is proposed to address the ambiguous and 
scalable problem. Existing temporal pattern mining assumes that events do not have 
any duration. However, events in many real world applications have durations, and 
the relationships among these events are often complex. These relationships are 
modeled using a hierarchical representation that extends Allen¡¦s interval algebra. 
However, this representation is lossy as the exact relationships among the events 
cannot be fully recovered. In this paper, we augment the hierarchical representation 
with additional information to achieve a lossless representation. An efficient 
algorithm called IEMiner is designed to discover frequent temporal patterns from 
interval-based events. The algorithm employs two optimization techniques to reduce 
the search space and remove non-promising candidates. From the discovered 
temporal patterns, we build an interval-based classifier called IEClassifier to 
differentiate closely related classes. Experiments on both synthetic and real world 
datasets indicate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach, as well as 
the improved accuracy of IEClassifier. General Terms Algorithms Keywords

INTRODUCTION Temporal pattern mining aims to discover useful relations that are 
hidden among events. Existing temporal mining algorithms [1, 10, 3, 12] have 
focused on discovering frequent temporal patterns from instantaneous events, that 
is, events with no duration. This assumption allows the discovered pattern to be 
simplified to an ordered sequence of events, such as However, such sequential 
patterns are inadequate to express the complex temporal relationships in domains 
such as medical, multimedia, meteorology and finance where the events¡¦ durations 
could play an important role. For example, it has been observed that in many 
diabetic patients, the presence of hyperglycemia1 overlaps with the absence of 
glycosuria2. This insight has led to the development of effective diabetic testing kits. 
In the case of dengue fever, knowing that there will be a decrease of platelet counts 
on the third day after the onset of fever has led to a better management of the 
disease. Clearly, there is a need for an efficient mining algorithm that can discover 
complex relationships among events with duration, also known as interval-based 
events. Furthermore, these discovered relationships could be used to build a 
classifier that is able to distinguish closely related classes. Mining complex 
interval-based relationships efficiently requires an unique yet lossless representation 
to capture the temporal relationships among events. Allen¡¦s interval algebra [2] has 
traditionally been used to represent the temporal relationship between two 
interval-based events. However, capturing the temporal relationships among three or 
more events remains an issue. Many approaches use a hierarchical representation [6, 
14] to encode the temporal relationships among events. This representation is lossy 
as it does not preserve the underlying temporal structure of the events. Any mining 
algorithm that is based on a lossy representation will lead to the discovery of many 
spurious patterns as non-frequent patterns may become frequent. Existing 
interval-based mining algorithms are either based on a lossy representation [8] or do 
not scale well [11, 15]. We overcome these drawbacks by devising a lossless 
representation. Based on the proposed representation, we design an interval-based 
event mining algorithm. The algorithm employs two optimization techniques to 
reduce the search space and remove non-promising candidates. Taking a step further, 
we examine how the discovered temporal patterns can be utilized in classification to 
differentiate closely related classes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
work to build an interval-based classifier. The contributions of this paper are as 
follow: We augment the hierarchical representation with count information to 
achieve a lossless representation. We provide a proof that the augmented 
representation is indeed lossless. This enables us to recover the actual relationships 
among events in the mining process. We design an Apriori-based algorithm called 
¡§IEMiner¡¨( Interval-based Event Miner) to discover frequent temporal patterns based 
on the lossless representation. IEMiner employs two optimization strategies to 
reduce the search space. The proof of the completeness of IEMiner is detailed. We 
also build an interval-based temporal pattern classifier called IEClassifier to perform 
the classification of closely related classes. We apply the classifier to a real world 
Hepatitis dataset to demonstrate its improved accuracy Experimental studies on both 
synthetic and real world datasets indicate that IEMiner is both efficient and scalable 
and outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. The IEClassi- fier improves the 
predictive accuracy on the real world Hepatitis dataset over traditional classifiers 
such as CBA [9], C4.5 [13] and SVM [5]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 gives the related work. Section 3 provides some preliminaries. Section 4 
introduces the augmented hierarchical-based representation. Section 5 describes the 
IEMiner algorithm and the optimization strategies. Section 6 presents the design of 
IEClassifier. Section 7 gives the experiment results and we conclude in Section 8 2. 
RELATED WORK There has been a stream of research on mining sequential patterns 
[3, 12, 10, 1]. These works assume that events have zero duration. Recent works have 
investigated the mining of interval-based events [8, 11, 15]. Kam et. al. [8] design an 
algorithm that uses the hierarchical representation to discover frequent temporal 
patterns. However, the hierarchical representation is ambiguous and many spurious 
patterns are found. Papapetrou et. al. [11] propose the H-DFS algorithm to mine 
frequent arrangements of temporal intervals. Both these works transform an event 
sequence into a vertical representation using id-lists. The id-list of one event is 
merged with the id-list of other events to generate temporal patterns. This approach 
does not scale well when the temporal pattern length increases. Wu et. al. [15] 
devise an algorithm called TPrefix for mining non-ambiguous temporal pattern from 
interval-based events. TPrefix first discovers single frequent events from the 
projected database. Next, it generates all the possible candidates between temporal 
prefix and discovered frequent events and scans the projected database again for 
support counting. TPrefixSpan has several inherent limitations: multiple scans of the 
database is needed and the algorithm does not employ any pruning strategy to 
reduce the search space. Discovered sequential patterns can be leveraged to obtain 
high confidence association rules useful for classification. Liu et. al. [9] propose a 
classification scheme based on association rules to improve the prediction accuracy. 
Recently, Cheng et. al. [4] present a detailed study of frequent pattern analysis for 
classification. In their approach, high discriminating frequent patterns are discovered 
from the non-sequential data. These patterns are used as additional features for 
classification. In our approach, we discover discriminative frequent patterns from 
sequential data and employ them for classification. In this paper, we have examined 
the problem of mining relationships among interval-based events. We augmented 
existing hierarchical representation with additional count information to make the 
representation lossless. Based on this new representation, we have developed an 
Apriori-based IEMiner algorithm to mine frequent temporal patterns from 
interval-based events. We designed an efficient support counting procedure. The 
performance of IEMiner is further improved by employing a window blacklisting 
strategy and a prefix counting strategy. Experiments on synthetic data sets and real 
world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our proposed approach. 
Beyond this, we have de-signed the first interval-based classifier, IEClassifier to 
improve the predictive accuracy of closely related classes. Experiment results on the 
Hepatitis dataset show that IEClassifier outperforms traditional classifiers such as 
C4.5, CBA, and SVM. After mapping the test results into interval based events, we 
create an event list for each patient. We obtain a total of 498 event lists that 
correspond to patients who undergo the 25 tests regularly. Figure 15 shows the 
results of applying the mining algorithms on the transformed Hepatitis dataset 
(Hep-T). We observe that IEMiner perform best compared to all algorithms. Here, 
average length of underlying event list is around 200 events. GenPrefixspan did not 
perform well because it consider events without duration and as a result many 
patterns are generated compared to other three algorithm. If the results of a test 
Test during an interval [start, end] oscillates between Low and High, we map it to the 
event (Test-LH, start, end).
